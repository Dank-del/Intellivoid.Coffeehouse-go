# Contributing to Coffeehouse-go Project

We're happy that you have chosen to contribute to the Coffeehouse-go project.

To organize the efforts made for this library, the Intellivoid Team has written this simple guide to help you.

> Please read this document completely before contributing to Coffeehouse-go.

<hr/>

## How To Contribute?

Coffeehouse-go has a `master` branch for stable releases and a `develop` branch for daily development.  New features and fixes are always submitted to the `develop` branch.

If you are looking for ways to help, you should start by looking at the [Help Wanted tasks](https://github.com/Dank-del/Intellivoid.Coffeehouse-go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22).

> Please let us know if you plan to work on an issue so that others are not duplicating work.

The Coffeehouse-go project follows standard [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).  

You should learn and be familiar with how to [use Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), how to [create a fork of Coffeehouse-go](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), and how to [submit a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

After you submit a PR, the Intellivoid Team will build your changes and verify all tests pass.  Project maintainers and contributors will review your changes and provide constructive feedback to improve your submission.

Once we are satisfied that your changes are good for Coffeehouse-go, we will merge it.

## Quick Guidelines

### Here are a few simple rules and suggestions to remember when contributing to Coffeehouse-go Project.

 * :bangbang: **NEVER** commit code that you didn't personally write.
 * **PLEASE** try keep your PRs focused on a single topic and of a reasonable size or we may ask you to break it up.
 * **PLEASE** be sure to write simple and descriptive commit messages.
 * **DO NOT** surprise us with new APIs or big new features. Open an issue to discuss your ideas first.
 * **DO NOT** reorder type members as it makes it difficult to compare code changes in a PR.
 * **DO** try to follow our [coding style](CODESTYLE.md) for new code.
 * **DO** give priority to the existing style of the file you're changing.
 * **DO NOT** send PRs for code style changes or make code changes just for the sake of style.
 * **PLEASE** keep a civil and respectful tone when discussing and reviewing contributions.
 * **PLEASE** tell others about Coffeehouse-go library and your contributions via social media.


## Stealing code

We prohibit stealing code from another person and/or another libraries.

There has been confusion on this point in the past, so we want to make this clear.  It is **NEVER ACCEPTABLE** to copy and paste another person's effort with your own name of a project. Even if the target is not Coffeehouse-go, this work will never be acceptable.

 * It **DOES NOT** matter how much you change the code.
 * It **DOES NOT** matter what country you live in or what your local laws say.  
 * It **DOES NOT** matter that another libraries are discontinued.  
 * It **DOES NOT** matter how small the bit of code you have stolen is.  
 * It **DOES NOT** matter what your opinion is of stealing code.

If you did not write the code, you do not have ownership of the code and you shouldn't submit it to Coffeehouse-go Project.

If we find a contribution to be in violation of copyright, it will be immediately removed.  
We will bar that contributor from the Coffeehouse-go project.

## Code guidelines

Due to limitations on private target platforms, Coffeehouse-go enforces the use of version 1.16 Golang.

It is however allowed to use the latest standard libraries, but if contributions make use of libraries which are not present in Go 1.16, it will be required from the contribution to implement backward compatible switches.

> Please notice that these limitations should be lifted at some point.
